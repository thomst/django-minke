Django

Minke is build as a django-application. For more informations about how to setup
a django-project please see the django-documentation:

* `Getting started with django <https://www.djangoproject.com/start/>`_

Celery

Minke uses celery to realize asynchrouniously and parrallel task-execution.
For more informations about how to setup a django-project with celery please
see the celery-documentation:

* `Getting started with celery <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/index.html>`_
* `First steps with django <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/django/first-steps-with-django.html>`_

.. note::
    Minke depends on a celery-setup with a working result-backend. We recommend
    to use the django-celery-result-extension:

    * `General informations about result-backends <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html#keeping-results>`_
    * `django-celery-result <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/django/first-steps-with-django.html#django-celery-results-using-the-django-orm-cache-as-a-result-backend>`_

Fabric

Minke uses fabric to realize remote-execution. Fabric itself is build on invoke
(command-execution) and paramiko (ssh-connections). Fabric and invoke
are highly configurable. Please see :doc:`fabricintegration` for more
informations about how to configure fabric within a minke-project.
