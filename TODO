* show-messages-toggle for session-changelist
* invoke-task-args as minke-form-fields
* reload changelist after processing all sessions
* upload-files and upload-session
* cleanup template and css:
  make a clearer distinction between the changelists of minkeobjects and sessions.
* Session-proc-info: display runtime for failed sessions
* uncouple the session-select-widget from the admin-action-form, so that sessions
  can be executed even if now admin-action is available.
* overwork contrib-command:
  - give current user run-permission for commands
  - add commands from select-form via popup
  - write tests
